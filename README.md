# FunctionalMotifs
Code to the paper "Functional Motifs in Foodwebs and Networks"

The code contains the module MotifFinder that uses interaction matrices to find a number of different motifs in food webs that have been associated with foodweb stability in previous studies and combinations of those motifs. Those motifs are
2 species:
  predator-prey
  mutualism (in apparent competition motifs)

3 species:
  apparent competition
  exploitative competition
  omnivory
  tri-trophic foodchains

4 species:
  four species foodchains
  bifan (combination of two exploitative competition motifs with the same predators)
  diamond (combination of apparent competition and exploitative competition motifs)
  combined tri-trophic foodchains (two tri-trophic chains that share the same top predator)
